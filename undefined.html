      <p>What do points, lines, planes, and sets have in common? Watch this video lesson to find out what they are, what they look like, and why they are called undefined terms.
Undefined Terms
How can something be undefined, especially in math? Surprisingly, there are four things that are undefined in geometry. This is what we will be talking about in this video lesson. We are not talking undefined in the sense that we would expect, but undefined in a different sense. These four things are called undefined terms because in geometry these are words that don't require a formal definition. They form the building blocks for formally defining or proving other words and theorems. These words themselves are considered so basic that they are considered to be true without having to be proved or formally defined.

So what are these four things? They are point, line, plane, and set. The first three are the more commonly referred to, but set is also one of them. Let's go on to see what each looks like and what each is.

Point
Picture a dot, any dot, and you are looking at a point. Points are used a lot in geometry. They appear by themselves at times but most often you will see points in connection with various shapes. When you see them with shapes, they are usually located at the corners of these shapes. Points are labeled with capital letters. These points for example, can be labeled as points A, B, and C. Mathematically, points have no size, width, or height. They don't take up any space. They are simply used as position markers.</p>
