Definition of Critical Thinking
From applying the scientific method, to covering a news story, to analyzing a crime scene, critical thinking is required. Thinking critically depends upon an open mind, reasoning, logic, questioning of assumptions, data, information, and evidence. In order to engage in critical thinking, a person must value evidence and facts rather than opinions or beliefs. In this lesson, we'll discuss five major dimensions of critical thinking. These include:

Analysis of thought
Assessment of thought
Disposition of thought
Skills for critical thinking
Barriers to critical thinking
The Analysis of Thought
What is it that makes thinking, something everyone on the planet does, critical? Critical thinking in this context means applying standards to the thinking process, in order to get honest, truthful, and objective results. Critical thinking standards include looking at the data, information, or evidence with clarity, accuracy, completeness, relevance, and intellectual honesty.

The key concept behind the process of analysis involves delineating a question or problem into discrete elements. For example, the scientific method, an institutionalized form of critical thinking, starts with a question. Then the topic of that question is researched, a hypothesis is posed, and experimentation is conducted. Finally, the results are interpreted and new questions may be formulated.

Thought: Assessment and Disposition
When you have gathered a body of knowledge about your question or problem, the process moves to assessing the data. Assessment begins by looking at the information or evidence critically. That means that you are aware of your point of view and your assumptions, and you separate these from the facts, so that you can correctly draw inferences or recognize implications from what the data is showing you.

The term disposition can refer to many things, but in the context of critical thought, it's generally in terms of temperament and motives. The critical thinker should be a person who seeks the truth. This means being open to alternatives when faced with new facts or evidence. In order to think critically, a person must seek clear and precise information and they should prefer evidence over opinions or biases. For instance, if your boss recommends using a new technique in selling products or answering clients' questions, you might research this technique, as well as strategies for implementing it, and figure out a way to try this out alongside your current strategies.</p>
