      <p>Deductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions from specific statements called premises. Learn more about deductive reasoning and test your knowledge with a quiz.
Defining Deductive Reasoning
Suppose that you wanted to find a fruit to eat. You look through the refrigerator and find a celery stick, a Granny Smith, and a cup of beans. You know that neither celery nor beans are fruits. You also know that all apples are fruits, and a Granny Smith is an apple. Therefore, the Granny Smith has to be a fruit.

This is an example of syllogism, a form of deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a type of logic where general statements, or premises, are used to form a specific conclusion. The other type of deductive reasoning is conditional reasoning.

Syllogisms
Syllogisms are deductive arguments that are written in the form:

A is B
C is A
Therefore, C is B

Let's take the example above. If we broke down the syllogism into premises and conclusions, we would get:

Premise: All apples are fruits.
Premise: A Granny Smith is an apple.
Conclusion: Therefore, a Granny Smith is a fruit.

According to the first premise, all items that are classified as apples are also classified as fruits. According to the second premise, Granny Smith is classified as an apple. The first premise is a general statement, while the second premise refers to a specific case. The conclusion says that a Granny Smith has to be a fruit because of its inherent properties as an apple. This deductive argument is also valid, which means that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. So, does a valid deductive argument mean that the premises and conclusions are true? Suppose I formed this deductive argument:</p>
